3. **Connect Your Application**:
   - In your server-side code, establish a connection to the SQL database.
   - Configure your application to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.

4. **Integrate with Your Application Logic**:
   - Update your application to interact with the SQL database for user authentication, project management, and transaction handling.

5. **Test and Debug**:
   - Ensure that the integration works correctly by testing user registration, project uploads, and transactions.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the documentation of the SQL database you're using or consult resources specific to your programming environment.
